This is a fake keygen early 00's style, the banner is an original
creation but the music belongs to [DJ CUTMAN](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHUjWhuXaXw).
To run execute `./run`

Requirements:
Some system packages are required:
`sudo apt install libcairo2-dev pkg-config python3-dev`
And also some python packages:
`pip3 install cairo pygame`

This is nothing serious, just a joke out of boredom!
